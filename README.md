# scantailor-advanced-osx
Homebrew formula and App bundler for Scantailor (Advanced)

See [4lex4/scantailor-advanced](https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced) for the original project.

To use the bundler, you need the fish shell (brew install fish) and the utility [macdeployqt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.9/osx-deployment.html) to do the linking. The bundler script will use the scantailor binary which is in your shell path.

**Look at the *Releases* section for a bundled App.**
